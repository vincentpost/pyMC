    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific taks and is only executed when it is called from somewhere else inside your program. You typically create functions when certain tasks have to be executed several times. So as a general rule, when you're programming and you find that you are repeating the same lines of code twice or more, then it is time to think about bundling them into a function. This leaves less room for errors and it makes your code much easier to read and understand. Moreover, it is less work to change the function than it is to change the code in all the places where repetition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block below demonstrates how a function is defined. The first line starts with `def`, which tells Python that you plan to define a function. After `def` comes the name of the function, `check_extreme_event` in this case. After the function name come parentheses. In this example, the word `value` appears between parentheses, meaning that the function `check_extreme_event` accepts an *argument*, which in this case is called `value`. Effectively, `value` is a variable that will be available inside (and only inside) the function. Note that the line with the function definition must end with a colon, and that all code that belongs to the function must be indented."
