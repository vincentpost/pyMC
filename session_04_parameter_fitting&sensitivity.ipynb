Let's see if we can improve the fit by optizing the `pan_factor` and the rainfall chloride concentration `Cl_rain`. There are a number of different ways to do it but here we will demonstrate the `lmfit` package. The [`lmfit` package](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py) provides a range of non-linear least-squares minimization and curve-fitting functions for Python.

    "## Model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This remainder of this notebook demonstrates a few different ways in which the effect of model parameters on the model outcomes can be quantified using Python. It is not a formal discussion of model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The main aim is to demonstrate the flexibility of Python when it comes to running models mulitple times, and to show the effect on the model outcomes. Parameters that are considered to be uncertain are the pan factor, the rainfall chloride concentration and the measured rainfall, evaporation and water volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will draw a number of samples from a normal distribution that respresent the uncertainty of the pan factor. The true value of the pan factor that was used to create the synthetic sample points was 1.3, which we'll use as the mean. Note that a slightly higher value was found during the calibration with `lmfit`, and that the standard error (i.e. the standard deviation) was reported to be approximately 0.064. In the example below we'll use a higher value, simply because it is then easier to see the differences between the model runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below uses the [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) module to define a normal probability distribution with a mean $\\mu_p$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_p$. The value of variable `N` defines the number of values that will be used to draw the probability density function. The `norm` function is used to create the normal distribution and is stored as `dist_p`. The values for the pan factors on the x axis are defined by first calculating the value that corresponds to the 1 and 99 percent percentiles. These values are used as limits for the range of `N` x values. The probability densities for `xp` are stored in `yp` and are obtained using the `pdf` method of `dist_p`."
