    "## Water balance model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how to create a water balance model for a farm dam (a tiny lake) in Australia. We continue with the data from the previous session and complete the data set that will become the model input. The figure below is a schematic representation of our water balance model. There are three fluxes: precipitation, evaporation and infiltration. The infiltration flux represents the flow of water from the lake to the groundwater. Inflow and outflow through the dam inlet and outlet are zero for the selected time period (no surface water flux).\n",
