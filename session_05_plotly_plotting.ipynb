    "# Intro to interactive plotting with Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    " In this notebook we will explore the [Plotly package](https://plotly.com/) for interactive plotting with Python. We will use the same geographical data and time series data as in the notebook on plotting with Bokeh to demonstrate the differences and similarities between the packages. The learning curve for Plotly is very steep and it is more focused on the commercial market than other Python packages, but it is useful to know about its capabilities. Plotly is closely linked to Dash, which can be used to create web-based data apps. Interesting examples of these can be found on [the example apps](https://plotly.com/examples/) page. This is worthy of a course on its own, in this notebooks we'll explore some of the basic plotting capabilities of Plotly.\n",

    "Plotly Express is Plotly's high-level API for creating figures in Python, which is intended to be able to create common figures quickly. We'll explore some of its options by revisiting the water balance dataset, and then we'll move on to the Switzerland data to showcase Plotly's interactive plotting capabilities. These require some classes and functions from Dash, hence the last line of imports in the code cell below."
